## Features

- Data fetching from backend via Axios
- For Authentication I use custom hooks (useLogin, useRegister and useLogout) and react-context
Example for login and register
```
import { useLogin } from '/hooks/useLogin';
import { useRegister } from '/hooks/useRegister';
...

const { login, error, isLoading } = useLogin()
const { register, error, isLoading } = useRegister()
...
const login = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        const newInfo = {
            email,
            password,
        }
        await login(newInfo)
    }

const register = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        const newInfo = {
            email,
            password,
        }
        await register(newInfo)
    }
```

- All data is stored in react saga (See in `redux` folder)
- All UI components are written in css modules and scss(Sass)
